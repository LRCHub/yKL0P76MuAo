Pay attention, my love, 'cause it's over
At the tip of my tongue is the price you weren't willing to pay
Still, this is something akin to a breakdown
And your impression of a woman supposed to be easy to see

That there'd be torn up photos and lonely nights
Cursing, crying, and drawn out fights
Make up sex and a brand new start
Broken promises for broken hearts

When you look back now was it special?
Or was it nothing but an anecdote that you can tell now and then?
And I delude myself, it was worth it
Mm, even though from the beginning I could see exactly how it would end

That there'd be torn up photos and lonely nights
Cursing, crying, and drawn out fights
Make up sex and a brand new start
Broken promises for broken hearts

Torn up photos and lonely nights
Cursing, crying, and drawn out fights
Make up sex and a brand new start
Broken promises for broken hearts

I wanna wish you away, wanna wish you away
Wanna wish you away, wanna wish you away
Wanna wish you away, wanna wish you away
Wanna wish you away, I wanna wish you away
Wanna wish you away, wanna wish you away
Wanna wish you away, I wanna kiss you away

Torn up photos and lonely nights
Cursing, crying, and drawn out fights
Make up sex and a brand new start
Broken promises for broken hearts
