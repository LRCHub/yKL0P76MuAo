I walked the streets of Vegas
I walked 'til I was blind
Something was shining on me promises
"Anything you want, anything you desire"

I soon became the servant
A blissful blank canvas mind
Something was shining on me - promises
"Anything you want, anything you desire"

Turn the bad blood into good
Bring the laughter, bring the love
Drink again, 'cause everyone forgets
In the land of broken promises

The gambling hungry eyes
The cocktail hours and neon lights
Something was shining on me - dollar signs
"Anything you want, anything you desire"

You know I wanna disappear but I just can't hide
The American dream is in every die
Something is telling me I'm out of time
"Anything you want, anything you desire"

Turn the bad blood into good
Bring the laughter, bring the love
Drink again, 'cause everyone forgets
In the land of broken promises [x2]
